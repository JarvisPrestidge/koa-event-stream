v0.1.1
In the bubble phase, add safety inspection logic.
If the ctx.body is a stream, the test can be written, and if it can be written, it is written to the stream.
If the ctx.body is another type, determine whether the sse flow is over. If it is not finished, the ctx.sse.send(ctx.body) is called, and then ctx.body=ctx.sse.
